To investigate the functional significance of genetic risk loci identified through genome-wide association studies (GWASs), genetic loci are linked to genes based on their capacity to account for variation in gene expression, resulting in expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). Following this, gene set analyses are commonly used to gain insights into functionality. However, the efficacy of this approach is hampered by small effect sizes and the burden of multiple testing. We propose an alternative approach: instead of examining the cumulative associations of individual genes within a gene set, we consider the collective variation of the entire gene set. We introduce the concept of gene set QTL (gsQTL), and show it to be more adept at identifying links between genetic risk variants and specific gene sets. Notably, gsQTL experiences less susceptibility to inflation or deflation of significant enrichments compared with conventional methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the broader applicability of shared variability within gene sets. This is evident in scenarios such as the coordinated regulation of genes by a transcription factor or coordinated differential expression.
